Integration
Integrating with Other Systems
If you want to integrate SmileTrack with other systems or third-party APIs, consider the following approaches:

REST API:

You can expose certain functionalities through a REST API. This will allow external applications to interact with SmileTrack for operations like fetching patient data or scheduling appointments.
Use Laravel's built-in routing and controller features to define API routes and controllers.
Webhooks:

Implement webhooks to notify external services about events (e.g., new patient added, appointment scheduled). This can be achieved using Laravel's event broadcasting features.
Frontend Integration:

Since SmileTrack uses React with Inertia.js, you can easily embed components or functionalities into existing React applications. Create reusable components in your React codebase that interact with the SmileTrack API.
External Authentication:

You can integrate external authentication services (like Google or Facebook) to allow users to log in with their existing accounts.
